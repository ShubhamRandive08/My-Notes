#### What is React?
	React is an external library that helps us create webistes easier.


	#External Library : Reac is not built into the browser. You must import or install it using <script> tag or npm instal react. External library means code outside of the computer as well as code that someone else wrote.

- React is a bunch of code that is outside of the our computer.
